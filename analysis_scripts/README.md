# Analysis Scripts

These scripts are used to create the Gnina run files and analyze the outputs of Gnina.

### make\_gnina\_cmds.py
Generates a file that will run the specified Gnina parameter sweeps. Requires a space-delimited file that lists receptor, ligand, autobox\_ligand, and the prefix of the Gnina output file.

### obrms\_calc.py
Calculates the RMSD from the poses in the Gnina output files to the known ligand binding pose using OpenBabel's *obrms* tool. Requires the Gnina command file generated by **make\_gnina\_cmds.py**

### coalescer.py
Creates a master csv containing rmsd information and scores output by Gnina.

### Data to create the figures

- **benchmark**: data for figures about runtime
- **redocking**: data from redocking runs (using the PDBbind refined set v.2019)
- **crossdocking**: data from cross-docking runs (using the Wierbowski et al. set)

The remaining files are used for the analysis figures describing the downsampling process used for cross-docking.
